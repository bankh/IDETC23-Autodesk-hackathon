## ü§î Problem Statement
- The hackathon's goal is to predict the `material_category` for each body in the [test set](dataset/test_data). The [train data](dataset) contains material category labels for each body of each assembly in the `assembly.json` files.
- Link to [PDF](Autodesk%20Hackathon%20Problem%20Statement%202023.pdf) with more information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions for Setup and Run 
- Clone the repository (e.g., ssh version below):
```
$ git clone git@github.com:bankh/IDETC23-Autodesk-hackathon.git
```
- Setup and activate conda environment:  
```
$ conda create --name=idetc python=3.8
$ source activate idetc
```
- Install required libraries:  
```
$ cd IDETC23-Autodesk-hackathon
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Note:__ One can find the setup of the Docker container for AMD-based GPUs [here](https://github.com/bankh/GPU_Compute/blob/main/Docker_images/AMD/readMe.md).  

## üíæ Dataset
- [Download instructions](dataset). Please note that the dataset has been modified for this hackathon, and you should only use data from these download instructions in your implementation.
  - The data has been modified to include in each `assembly.json` file a `material_category` label for each body. This label, which describes the material category of the body as defined in the table above, can be used to train your model.
- **Dataset Specifications:** Please refer to [the original documentation](https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/Fusion360GalleryDataset/blob/master/docs/assembly.md) of the Fusion 360 Gallery Dataset for information about the structure of the data in `assembly.json` and to find out more about the features in the dataset.

The assembly data is provided in a JSON file with the following top-level structure ([from the original documentation](https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/Fusion360GalleryDataset/blob/master/docs/assembly.md)) :

```{js}
{
    "tree": {...},
    "root": {...},
    "occurrences": {...},
    "components": {...},
    "bodies": {...},
    "joints": {...},
    "as_built_joints": {...},
    "contacts": [...],
    "holes": [...],
    "properties": {...}
}
```

The table below briefly describes the top-level data elements in the JSON:

| Element      | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tree`   | The designer-defined hierarchy of occurrences in the design. Often used to organize sub-assembles into a meaningfully hierarchy        |
| `root`      | The root component of the design as defined by the designer       |
| `occurrences`   | Instances of components, referencing the parent component with instance properties such as location, orientation, and visibility        |
| `components`   | Components containing bodies or other components to form sub-assemblies        |
| `bodies`   | The underlying 3D shape geometry in the B-Rep format        |
| `joints`   | Constraints defining the relative pose and degrees of freedom (DOF) between a pair of occurrences        |
| `as_built_joints`   | Joints that maintain their position in space and are not transformed        |
| `contacts`   | Faces that are in contact between different bodies        |
| `holes`   | A list of hole features with information about the type of hole, size, direction, and location        |
| `properties`   | Statistical information and metadata about the overall assembly        |

The structure and representation of the data follow the [Fusion 360 API](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-A92A4B10-3781-4925-94C6-47DA85A4F65A).  

## üìä Baseline 
- A GPT-based baseline can be found [here](baseline/gpt_baseline_training.ipynb).
- This can serve as an example of how to extract useful features from the data, and how to evaluate the method.

The cost of gpt-3.5-turbo for training set (~2000+ samples) was about __0.40 USD__.

## ToDo
- [x] Finish cloning, setting up, and installing the repository.
- [x] Run the baseline algorithm and generate the submission file for workflow validation.
- [ ] Implement the method from (Bian, 2022) and compare results.
