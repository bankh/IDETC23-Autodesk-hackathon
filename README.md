# 2023 IDETC Hackathon - Automating Material Selection for Product Design   
Welcome to the Autodesk problem statement for the 2023 IDETC hackathon!
In this challenge, your task is to come up with an open-ended solution to identify an appropriate material for a set of parts, based on their CAD geometries and assembly context. 

| **Material   Category** 	| **Definition**                           	| **Example(s)**         	|
|-------------------------	|------------------------------------------	|------------------------	|
| Metal_Aluminum          	| Aluminum-based metal                     	| Aluminum alloy         	|
| Metal_Ferrous           	| Ferrous metal (excluding carbon   steel) 	| Cast iron              	|
| Metal_Ferrous_Steel     	| Carbon steel                             	| Stainless steel        	|
| Metal_Non-Ferrous       	| Non-Ferrous metal                        	| Platinum, silver       	|
